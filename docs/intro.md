# Pody

Pody is a container manager that adds a layer of abstraction on top of Docker. 
It uses server-client architecture to expose a RESTful API for managing containers.  

Specifically: 

- It restricts the user to only manage containers under the user's namespace.  
- Limit avaliable images and their exposed ports to a predefined list.  
- Easy resource management and monitoring.
